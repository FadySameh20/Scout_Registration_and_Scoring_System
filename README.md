# Scout_Registration_and_Scoring_System
Scout registration and scoring system is a program which I developed for my scout to make my task much easier. Through this program, I can register all my team members so that I have a full database about them (name, team name, date of birth, mobile number, national ID). Moreover, each team member has his own points based on the activities and tasks accomplished. Last but not least, I can display all members sorted by their points to create a competitive atmosphere and bring prizes for the ones with most points.
